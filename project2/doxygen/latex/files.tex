\doxysection{File List}
Here is a list of all documented files with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{code/\mbox{\hyperlink{algorithms_8cpp}{algorithms.\+cpp}} \\*This file contains implementations of TSP algorithms using different techniques/approaches, as well as the utility functions used in them }{\pageref{algorithms_8cpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{code/\mbox{\hyperlink{main_8cpp}{main.\+cpp}} \\*This file contains the menu interface. It is the entry point of the program. Not much goes one here, as the main purpose of this file is to call the menu function, as well as populate the graph and call the algorithms functions when the user selects an option }{\pageref{main_8cpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{code/\mbox{\hyperlink{utils_8cpp}{utils.\+cpp}} \\*This file contains utility functions for the project. Namely graph population and csv file parsing. There are also functions used to compute the execution time of a function and to clear a graph }{\pageref{utils_8cpp}}{}
